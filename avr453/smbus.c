Slave Mode
-------------



Master Mode
-------------

Master mode is initiated by foreground code.  When a message is available for
transmission via Master mode (typically due to a timer expiring), it
is placed in the TWI Master TX buffer.  However, transmission cannot begin
immediately due to the SMBus requirement that "A bus master is required to
check for bus idle time of 50 us."

To meet this requirement, the AVR's pin-change detection mechanism is used
to monitor for bus idle conditions.  PA5 must be wired externally to the
SMBCLK signal (pin 5 on CONN1) to allow this functionality.  (Alternately,
in the user's production system, any I/O signal with pin-change capability
can be used instead of PA5 if desired.)  PA5 is also used to check for the
SMCLK pin being held low for extended periods by other devices on the bus
as well as checking if the AVR itself doing so locally.

A 3-level system is employed to ensure bus availability.  First, the presence
of a message in the transmit buffer results in execution of the foreground code
that manages Master mode.  Next, if the Slave state machine is not in the
IDLE state, no attempt is made to take control of the bus.  Lastly, PA5 is
checked to be sure it is not currently at a logical zero condition.  At this
point the bus appears to be free, so a flag (called TEST50US) is asserted to
indicate that the 50uS test has now begun; the Pin-Change Interrupt for PA5 is
also enabled.  The foreground SMBus Master mode management code is then exited.
With a clock speed of only 1MHz, 50 uS corresponds to only 50 instructions at
most.  Therefore, when the code is re-entered it is guaranteed that at least
50uS has passed.

When the pin-change interrupt is active, bus activity will
trigger the pin-change interrupt.  The corresponding ISR will clear the TEST50US
flag, indicating that the bus is not free.  Thus, when the foreground code is
re-entered, if the flag is not asserted but there is a message in the buffer,
it is understood that the test has failed and must be started again; thus the
flag will again be asserted and the routine will be exited.

When the foreground code is eventually re-entered with the flag still asserted,
and if the PA5 pin is not low, and the TWI ISR Slave State Machine is in IDLE,
action is immediately taken to begin transmission while the bus is free.  An
additional interlock flag (SMLOCK) is asserted to indicate that Master mode has
been entered by the TWI Hardware, so that the foreground code will not attempt to
repeatedly initiate a transmission for the same message.  (Note that checking
for the IDLE state is required due to the possibility that the ISR could have
been activated just after the flag was last asserted.  Additionally it is possible
that another slave device is halting the bus by keeping SMCLK low for an extended
period, so this needs to also be checked before attempting to take over the bus.)

If the AVR is successful in taking ownership of the bus, at the completion of the
transmission of the desired Slave address the ISR will be activated with a Status
code of 0x??.  As a result, the state machine will now vector into the states
related to Master Mode transmission, and the ISR will handle all further aspects
of the transmission.  Alternately, if the TWI module is unsuccessful in taking over
the bus, the TWI ISR will still be entered but with Status codes that are indicative
of an error having occurred.  In this latter case, the SMLOCK and TEST50US flags will
be cleared to force another bus takeover attempt in the future.

//TWI Interrupt Service Routine
//  This ISR contains a state machine for handling the low-level bus communications.
//  It uses the variable TWI_CmdFlags to communicate the need for message processing
//    to the foreground-based command interpreter.  Whenever it passes control off
//    to the foreground routine, the SMBus is halted.

/* Changes to the operation of the SMBus State Machine as of 6/17/2005 (rgf):

   Since there can be multiple Masters on the bus addressing a Smart Battery,
   namely either a Host or a Charger, it is entirely possible that one Master
   may support PEC while the other does not.  For maximum reliability, we must
   be able to support the reception of PEC on-the-fly regardless of whether it
   was used in the past or not.

   To do so, we determine an expected byte count WITHOUT PEC.  While receiving,
   we decrement this counter and store received bytes until either (a) the counter
   drops below a value of (-1), or (b) we receive a STOP.  If we receive a STOP
   and the counter is not either 0 or -1, this is an error and is flagged as such.
   (Note that AFTER receiving a STOP, it is not possible to flag an error to the
   Host or Charger except through the Battery Status flags.)  If the counter is
   zero, this indicates that PEC is disabled.  If the counter is -1, this indicates
   that PEC is enabled.  The message will be processed with this knowledge.

   However, since the SCL line is not being held low due to TWINT being left asserted,
   a different mechanism is needed to hold off incoming messages to the battery
   until the previous message has been processed.  This is done by turning off
   the generation of ACK on any subsequent bytes and/or messages until the foreground
   code has finished processing the prior message.

   It is crucial therefore that the foreground code does not change the
   value of the TWI_CmdFlags variable from being equal to 'SMB_GotCmdData'
   until after it is completely done with processing of the prior message.

   This mechanism also is valid if a Master attempts to perform a Master Read
   while the battery is busy.  In this case, the second byte from the Master,
   specifically the SMBus Command byte, will not be acknowledged.  The Master
   is thereby required to generate a STOP condition.

/* Some important notes from the SMBus specs:

Insertion or removal of a Smart Battery may be detected when the Safety Signal transitions from or to an
open-circuit value (>100k.)

When an SMBus device acting as the bus master detects an error, it must attempt to return the bus to the idle
state by generating a STOP condition.

The Smart Battery must ALWAYS acknowledge its own address. Failure to do so might cause the SMBus
Host or Smart Battery Charger to incorrectly assume the Smart Battery is NOT present in the system,
although the Safety Signal can be used to detect the presence of a Smart Battery in a system. Note
however that the Smart Battery may choose not to acknowledge any byte following its address if it is
busy or otherwise unable to respond. If this occurs, the requestor should re-try the data request.

After each SMBus transaction directed to the Smart Battery device address, the Smart Battery must place
the appropriate error code in the lower nibble of the BatteryStatus() register. If the transaction completed
successfully, the error codes should be cleared to signify that no error was detected. Timeout and other
errors not described by one of the error code types may be signaled with an Unknown Error.

Another device may try to interrogate the battery immediately after a transaction from the Host.
The safest method to insure that the read of BatteryStatus() corresponds to the most recently read data value
is to perform this read of BatteryStatus() immediately after the read of the initial data value. This may be
accomplished by issuing a SMBus START condition after the SMBus STOP condition from the previous
transmission.

A bus master is required to check for bus idle time of 50 us.

The Smart Battery enters the On State whenever it detects that the SMBus Clock and Data lines go high.
The battery should be active and able to communicate via the SMBus within 1 ms of detecting these SMBus
lines going high.

The Smart Battery may not begin *broadcasting* ChargingVoltage(), ChargingCurrent() or AlarmWarning()
messages to either the SMBus Host or Smart Battery Charger for at least 10 seconds after entering the On
State.

When the Smart Battery enters the On State the following values must be reinitialized:
Function (Data Value) 		Initial Value 		
---------------------	----------------------------	
BatteryMode() 		Bit 15: CAPACITY_MODE=0
			Bit 14: CHARGER_MODE=0
			Bit 13: ALARM MODE=0
			Bit 9: PRIMARY_BATTERY=0
			Bit 8: CHARGE_CONTROLLER_ENABLED=0


The Smart Battery may enter the Off State whenever the SMBus Clock and Data lines both remain low
for greater than 2.5 seconds.

There is no limit to the speed (other than SMBus limits) or rate at which data may be requested from the
Smart Battery. Continuous data polling at high rates is permitted and allowed, though not encouraged due
to limitations on SMBus bandwidth and availability. The Smart Battery may delay any data request by
holding the CLOCK line low for up to 25 ms. This may be done in order to re-calculate the requested data
value or to retrieve data from a storage device.
