/*
1.1.4	Battery protection detection levels
The characterization of the Deep Under-voltage, Over-current and Short-circuit detection levels
show that the actual thresholds are typically 10% below the numbers given in the datasheet. This
is caused by parasitic elements in the layout that are not included in the simulation models.
The spread in these thresholds are however in the expected range of +/-5% for Over-current
detection levels, and +/-3% for Deep Under-voltage detection levels.

Detailed characterization data will be given in the Analog characterization report.

Workaround for ATmega406 rev. D:
As long as the actual range for these detection levels covers the required range for the
application used for qualification of ATmega406 rev. D, a correct detection level can always be found.

ATmega406 fix:
We assume that it is sufficient to update the datasheet with the actual detection levels found
during characterization. If not, the thresholds can be tuned to better fit the specification in the datasheet.
